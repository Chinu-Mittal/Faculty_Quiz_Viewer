## **Description**
QuizMaster is a Java-based application that allows students to attempt quizzes and saves their results to a file for persistent storage. Faculty members can review these quiz results to evaluate student performance. The project demonstrates core Java programming concepts, including:

- **Inheritance**: To create a structured hierarchy for shared functionality between `Student` and `Faculty` classes.
- **Exception Handling**: To ensure smooth execution by managing errors such as invalid inputs or file-related issues.
